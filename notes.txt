Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management 
library for React applications. It provides a simple API 
based on hooks and does not require boilerplate or provider
 components like some other state libraries. 

Immer middleware helps keep the react state persistent 
and allows you to use the same state across multiple 
components without worrying about the state being 
overwritten or lost. 

(ur always mutating the new state and not the existing state)


onRehydrateStorage ->  listener function provided in the persist 
middleware configuration that gets called when the
 state is rehydrated 

brings the state from local storage
to our application (this is what hydration means in zustand 
lingo)

import 
interface definitions

||zustand store immer persist||

rehydration

Zustand optimizes fine-grained re-rendering so components only re-render when the specific parts of the store they use change. useEffect with useState can lead to more frequent or unnecessary re-renders if not carefully optimized.
